# How Is The Surf Today
How-Is-The-Surf-Today is a series of python scripts that crawl the Surfline API and gather the status for every break around the world. It saves swell, wind, and other data in a CSV file, then generates an HTML page that graphs and sorts the breaks based on their min and max surf size as well as the forecast status.

The scripts are not hosted anywhere, so currently this program only runs if my laptop is on and the chronjob executes.
